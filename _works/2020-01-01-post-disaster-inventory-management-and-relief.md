## Summary

**Post-Disaster Relief & Inventory Supply Management (PRISM)** is an advanced decision support system designed to address one of the most pressing challenges in humanitarian logistics: **managing inventories and supply flows in the aftermath of natural disasters.**

At its core, **PRISM** integrates a comprehensive **simulation framework** that captures the dynamics of disrupted supply chains, fluctuating demand, infrastructure failures, and uncertain recovery timelines. Building on this foundation, it employs a **Markov Decision Process (MDP)** model to enable dynamic allocation and replenishment strategies that continuously adapt as new information emerges in disaster environments. **PRISM** equips policymakers, NGOs, and emergency response agencies with the ability to determine:  
- Where to preposition relief items
- How to allocate scarce resources during crises
- How to adapt operations over time as conditions evolve

By combining **stochastic modeling, simulation, and MDP-based optimization**, the system delivers not only near-optimal solutions but also **robust, real-time decision guidance**.

Beyond its academic contributions, **PRISM** offers substantial societal impact. It provides **actionable tools** for organizations such as **AFAD in Turkey, the Red Crescent, and international humanitarian agencies**, helping them **strengthen preparedness, accelerate response times, reduce shortages, and ultimately save lives**.  By transforming how relief logistics are planned and executed, **PRISM** directly supports the development of **more resilient communities** in the face of future disasters.
