## Summary

The **Aircraft Tail Assignment System** helps airlines solve one of their most complex planning challenges: assigning aircraft to flights at the tail-number level. By considering **operational and technical constraints** such as maintenance schedules, ground times, routing restrictions, cabin configurations, and crew continuity, the system generates flight assignments that maximize **efficiency, profitability, and reliability**.  

We developed a **mathematical optimization model**, applied **advanced heuristics**, and built a **robust scheduling engine** that:  
- Reduces maintenance frequency  
- Maximizes fleet utilization  
- Increases passenger capacity  

Beyond optimization, the system enhances **coordination across departments** including maintenance, operations, and crew planning, resulting in smoother and more cost-effective workflows. With direct integration to real airline data, it enables **adaptive, transparent, and data-driven planning** â€” delivering measurable improvements in **profitability, resource utilization, and operational resilience**.
