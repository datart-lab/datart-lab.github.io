## Summary

The **Single Runway Dual Overhead Crane Scheduling Engine** addresses the critical challenge of coordinating two cranes sharing the same runway while avoiding collisions and minimizing idle time. We developed a tailored **dynamic programming approach** combined with heuristics to generate efficient schedules under real-world industrial constraints. The engine dynamically assigns tasks, incorporates safety buffers, and adjusts to operational uncertainties.  

A built-in **simulation module** evaluates schedule feasibility in real time, ensuring resilience against disruptions. With this capability, factories and warehouses gain a powerful decision support tool that significantly reduces task completion times and improves overall system throughput.
