## Summary

The **Refueling and Recharging Optimization Engine** is designed to support autonomous vehicle operations by determining the most efficient energy replenishment strategies. Developed from the ground up, we built the complete system â€” from the **mathematical optimization formulation** to the **selection of tailored algorithms** and the **implementation of the full engine code**.  

By accounting for **energy availability and operational requirements**, the engine reduces downtime and ensures consistent replenishment. This comprehensive decision support system balances **efficiency and reliability**, enabling autonomous vehicles to operate with greater continuity, higher utilization, and improved overall performance.
